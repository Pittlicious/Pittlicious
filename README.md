- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pittlicious
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything... Which is a problem when it comes to deciding what I want to work on because I would like to just work on everything. However to tie it down, most things gaming, reading,
      motorsport and history. (This section will probably get updated because there's just so many things I'm interested in. Almost like YouTube's Watch Later folder.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C#, JS, HTML, CSS... The things you'll find in my projects. If it's not programming related then creative writing~
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... just viewing and reading what everyone else is working on till I build confidence in my own projects
- 📫 How to reach me ... here. 😐
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I used the generic template for this README because I'm unsure of what to put in here~
